# NBA-NMF
Repository for NBA-NMF Project

### Project Summary:

Non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) is an unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction technique that can be used to find hidden-structures in data. In this project, I use NNMF to uncover structure NBA shooting data. Using NNMF still involves trial and error, as it is difficult (if not impossible) to predict how many components you should decompose the data into to find the most interpretable output. See the NNMF section for more details.

The project is broken down into four parts:

1. Scraping the required data via Beautiful Soup; cleaning the data
2. Visualizing the data via matplotlib and seaborn
3. Implementing and applying NNMF algorithm from scratch
4. Summarize the output
